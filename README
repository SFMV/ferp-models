# To run the tool

To install all necessary third-party tools like SAT solvers and to build our
tools, the script install.py is provided. The full tool chain is called via
pipeline.py <qbf> <f> where <qbf> is the input QBF in QDIMACS format and
<f> is the name of the file in which the generated winning strategy is stored.
