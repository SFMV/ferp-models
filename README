# To run the tool
1. Move to the code folder.

2. Run requirements.py. To install all necessary third-party tools like SAT solvers and to build our

pipeline.py <qbf> <f> where <qbf> is the input QBF in QDIMACS format and
<f> is the name of the file in which the generated winning strategy is stored.
